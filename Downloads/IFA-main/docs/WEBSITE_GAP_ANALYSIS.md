|------|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Agent count** | 77 | **74** | Update all mentions to 74 (Process, Philosophy, FutureTeaser, LiveTicker, coming-soon). |
| **Contact email** | contact@insightfusion.com | **insightfusionanalytics@gmail.com** | Use official email in Footer and any contact links. |
| **Hero stats** | 50+ Strategies, 95% Accuracy | **52+ Projects**, **100% Client Success Rate** | Align stats with Company Profile. |

---

## Missing or under-represented content

### 1. **Stock market / algorithmic trading focus**

- **Documents:** IFA is positioned as “Enterprise-Grade **Algorithmic Trading Solutions**” and “Stock Market Services” with 74-agent pipeline, USDF, zero-coding.
- **Website:** Hero and messaging lean on “First Principle Company,” “Data Science,” and multi-domain (Stock, Sports, Business). Algorithmic trading is one line among others.
- **Suggestion:** Add a clear tagline or hero line such as “Enterprise-Grade Algorithmic Trading Solutions” and/or “Stock Market Services” so the PDF positioning is visible on the site.

### 2. **Services (from Services Menu PDF)**

The PDF lists these in detail; the site has no equivalent “Services” section with the same structure:

- **Strategy Development & Backtesting** (custom strategy, backtesting engines, walk-forward, Monte Carlo, reports, paper trading).
- **Live Trading & Execution** (Zerodha, Fyers, Dhan, Shunya, IBKR, Binance; OMS; &lt;500ms latency; risk management).
- **Data & Analytics** (historical/real-time, TimescaleDB, 100+ indicators, pattern recognition, regime detection, sentiment).
- **Specialized Markets** (Options, Crypto, Indian NSE/BSE, Forex, Leveraged ETF, Portfolio optimization).
- **Platform Services** (scanners, copy trading, webhooks, TradingView→broker, dashboards).
- **Machine Learning & Advanced Analytics** (ML models, walk-forward CV, hyperparameter tuning, ONNX, reverse engineering).

**Action:** Add a **Services** section (or page) that mirrors these six pillars (even in summary form with “Learn more” links or expandable blocks).

### 3. **Platforms & brokers (tables from documents)**

- **Platforms:** TradingView (PineScript), MetaTrader 4/5, Python, AmiBroker, NinjaTrader, QuantConnect, TradeStation, ProRealTime, cTrader, AlgoTest.
- **Brokers:** Indian – Zerodha, Fyers, Dhan, Shunya; International – IBKR, Binance, MT4/MT5 bridges; Markets – NSE/BSE, US, Options, Futures, Forex, Crypto.

**Action:** Add a “Platforms & Brokers” or “Supported Platforms” subsection (e.g. under Services or About) with these tables or a simplified visual list.

### 4. **How it works (4 steps – Services Menu)**

PDF steps:

1. **Strategy Intake** – USDF, no coding.
2. **Validation & Design** – AI validation, pricing, timeline.
3. **Development & Testing** – Code generation, backtesting, 74-agent validation.
4. **Delivery & Deployment** – Production code, reports, deployment guides, optional live setup.

**Action:** Align the **Process** section copy with these four steps and naming (and keep “74-agent” validation).

### 5. **Why choose IFA (from documents)**

PDF “Why Choose” points:

- Enterprise-grade quality (74 agents, zero tolerance for incomplete specs).
- Institutional testing (bias detection, walk-forward, transaction costs, audit trails).
- No coding required (USDF → full pipeline).
- Universal platform support (any platform/broker/market).
- Full-proof guarantee (acceptance tests, dispute prevention).
- Proven track record (52+ projects, 100% success).

**Action:** Ensure **Why Us** (and/or About) reflects these six points; current “Data Accuracy / Data Validation / Client-Centric / Robust Models” can stay but add or link to the document wording.

### 6. **Quality guarantees (bullets)**

Documents list: zero incomplete specs, bias auditing, acceptance testing, code quality, execution quality, documentation, human oversight.

**Action:** Add a short “Quality Guarantees” or “Our Standards” block (e.g. under Why Us or Process) with these bullets.

### 7. **Case studies (Case Studies Portfolio PDF)**

PDF has **6 case studies** with client type, challenge, solution, technical details, results:

1. Automated Options Income Strategy (US retail).
2. High-Frequency Intraday System (Indian market).
3. Crypto Perpetual Futures Arbitrage (Singapore fintech).
4. Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization (Hedge fund).
5. Machine Learning Momentum Strategy (UK quant).
6. Indicator Reverse Engineering (India retail).

**Website:** “Selected Works” / Portfolio shows 4 generic cards (High-Frequency Trading, Predictive Odds Engine, Churn Prediction, Risk Management), not the PDF case studies.

**Action:** Add a **Case Studies** section or page that either: (a) lists all 6 with short summaries and “Read full study” (PDF or modal), or (b) replaces/extends the current Portfolio cards with these 6, keeping confidentiality (e.g. “Options income automation”, “Indian F&O intraday”, “Crypto arbitrage”, etc.).

### 8. **Company profile – stats and positioning**

- **52+ projects | 74 agents | 10+ platforms | 100% client success** – use in Hero or a stats bar.
- **Mission:** “Democratize institutional-grade algorithmic trading…” – ensure this appears in About or Philosophy.
- **Client types:** Retail traders, professional firms, fintech startups, research institutions – can be a small “Who we serve” block.

**Action:** Add an explicit stats strip and “Who we serve” and mission sentence where it fits (Hero, About, or Philosophy).

### 9. **Service delivery process (Company Profile)**

Five phases with rough timing:

- Phase 1: Intake & validation (1–2 days).
- Phase 2: Development (3–10 days).
- Phase 3: Quality assurance (1–2 days).
- Phase 4: Delivery & deployment (1–2 days).
- Phase 5: Support & revisions (ongoing).  
- **Typical turnaround: 5–15 days.**

**Action:** Optionally add a “Delivery process” or “Timeline” subsection (e.g. under Process) with these phases and “5–15 days” headline.

### 10. **Competitive advantages (Company Profile)**

Seven points: Zero-coding automation, Multi-platform expertise, Institutional standards for all, Universal broker support, Specialized market expertise, Reverse engineering capability, Continuous quality improvement.

**Action:** Use in “Why Us” or a dedicated “Advantages” subsection (short bullets or icons).

### 11. **Technology stack (Company Profile)**

Documents mention: Claude Opus, GPT-4o, n8n; TimescaleDB, Redis, PostgreSQL; vectorbt, backtrader, pandas; broker SDKs; scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, ONNX; pytest, etc.

**Action:** Optional “Technology” or “How we build it” block for technical audiences (e.g. under About or a dedicated section).

### 12. **FAQ section**

Screenshots show an FAQ (“What is data analytics…”, “What industries…”, “How do ML services benefit…”, “How secure is data…”, “What support after implementation?”). The current codebase has no FAQ component.

**Action:** Add an **FAQ** section (accordion) with these questions and answers aligned to the documents.

### 13. **30-minute consultation CTA**

Screenshots show a dark banner: “YOU WILL GET EXPERT 30-MINUTE CONSULTATION” with “BOOK NOW” and expert image/signature.

**Action:** Add a CTA banner (e.g. above footer or in FutureTeaser) for “30-Minute Expert Consultation” / “Book now” linking to contact or booking.

### 14. **Footer**

- **Newsletter:** Screenshots show “Subscribe Our Newsletter” with email + Send. Current footer has no signup.
- **Contact:** Add phone if desired (e.g. +91 88876 52936 from screenshot).
- **Email:** Use **insightfusionanalytics@gmail.com** everywhere.
- **Quick links:** Align with sitemap (Home, About, Services, Team, Hiring, Blog, Shop, Contact) if those pages exist or are planned.

**Action:** Add newsletter block, correct email, optional phone; optionally add “Sitemap” or match link list to PDF/screenshots.

### 15. **Team names**

Screenshots: Anmol Pathak (CEO), **Prajwal Kankli** (Technology Head), **Chinmay Badani. J** (Machine Learning Engineer), Ritik Kumar, Ravi Shinde, Nayan Halder.  
Current code: Prajwal **Joshi**, Chiresh **Babbu**.

**Action:** Confirm correct names with HR/marketing and update **Team** component to match (Kankli/Badani vs Joshi/Babbu).
